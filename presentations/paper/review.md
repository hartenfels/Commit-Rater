### Research Questions
- ~~What are the best practices and how could such a set of criterias be achieved. Maybe an example of a good and a bad commit would help the reader to understand how a best practice could help them maintain their software even better.~~ Habe ein paar dumme Beispiele eingef√ºgt.
- ~~Why is there a lack of availability for those criterias stated in RQ1? You stated in your abstract that the official Git documentation states very clear guidelines regarding the commit messages. ~~ Ich denke es ist klar dass die Kriterien aus den offiziellen Guidelines limitiert sind.
- ~~Maybe you could say some sentences why every developer does not keep to these guidelines.~~ Finde zwar das muss man eigentlich nicht sagen aber ich hab noch nen Paragraphen dazu geschrieben.
Overall the research questions are good but i am missing the point why the excursion is moving to sentiment analysis. Although its very clear that the personal mood contributes largely to the commit message i think describing this aspect would improve this section even more.

### Methodology
- Why were especially those repos chosen and how is the level of awareness measured for authors of each repository? Giving an example of a certain commit message and why its bad or good practice would improve this section.

- Data synthesis: Describing more in detail why those chosen criterias benefit the RQ1 to obtain a good commit would improve this chapter even more. The chosen criterias are good and are well described why they were chosen.

- Data analysis: Avoid using the keyword can and could in the data anylsis e.g. analysis could be done... if you are doing it in your research maybe replacing this words would make the reader more confident in your research. Why are there 6 possibilities if your are only stating 3 and describing 4?

### Results
The result section of your research is very clear and you answer your research questions. Although the first research question is answered implicit. Although i think it's okay. Overall i think the machine learning section was only introduced because of the requirement of this course to use a machine learning approach. You even stated that this machine learning approach is not suited for all criterias. Improving this section by integrating this machine learning approach more with your RQ2 would improve the whole section. In your last sentence you state that a different way of validation needs to be used. It would be good to point out some alternatives or point to future work/conclusion.

### Threats to validity
Internal threats: You say that your criteria is incomplete. Threats should describe what could influence your research therefore i think you should move this part to the result section.


Overall your paper is good.
