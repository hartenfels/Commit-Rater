\section{Methodology}

The methodology section must give a very clear account of what sort of
procedure was executed. Here are some detailed criteria:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The section is preferably a step-by-step procedure overall. First we did
  this. Then we did this.
\item Steps should be motivated or defended, whenever it is not
  obvious why a certain choice was made. However, one should be
  careful not to preempt the discussion of threats to validity; see
  the extra section below.
\item The text should support reproducibility. In particular, a
  reasonably knowledgeable person should be able to re-execute the
  methodology and compare the results.
\item The text should not get into low-level (implementation)
  details. These can be deferred to separate documentation; see Appendix~\ref{S:details}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data extraction}

This metamodel is concerned with MSR papers. Thus, the methodology
section would be reasonably subdivided into the three major phases of
an MSR research project.

The subsection on data extraction is concerned with issues like the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item What repository was chosen and why?
\item What sort of extraction techniques is applied?
\item What sort of extra processing (e.g., filtering) is applied?
\item What constraints were chosen to help with scalability?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data synthesis}

Even the simplest MSR project carries out synthesis; data analysis (see
below) may not be carried out in all the cases. The subsection on data
synthesis is concerned with issues like the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item What metrics are used?

\item What machine learning techniques are used?

\item What information retrieval techniques are used?

\end{itemize}

The typical MSR paper picks either metrics or machine learning or IR.

\subsection{Data analysis}

Data analysis would be concerned with any sort of statistical quality
analysis of the data. More specifically, the subsection on data
analysis is concerned with issues like the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Simple statistics like median of metrics.

\item Analysis of regression or correlation or distribution.

\item Analysis of accuracy such as precision and recall.

\end{itemize}

It should be noted that the methodology section describes the `how'
(and to some extent the`why'), but it does not yet report the various
results; see the following section. For instance, the methodology may
explain why it is using a certain metric and define it and announce
that the median for the metric is going to be determined, as it would
provide a certain insight, but the actual tables or charts for the
metric and the interpretation of the findings would be deferred to the
results section.
